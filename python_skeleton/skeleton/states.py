        '''
        Advances the game tree by one action performed by the active player.

        Args:
            action: The action being performed. Must be one of:
                - DiscardAction: Player discards a card from their hand and adds it to the board
                - FoldAction: Player forfeits the hand
                - CallAction: Player matches the current bet
                - CheckAction: Player passes when no bet to match
                - RaiseAction: Player increases the current bet

        Returns:
            Either:
            - RoundState: The new state after the action is performed
            - TerminalState: If the action ends the hand (e.g., fold or final call)

        Note:
            The button value is incremented after each action to track whose turn it is.
            For DiscardAction, the card is added to the board and the hand is updated. Also, advances to the next street.
            For FoldAction, the inactive player is awarded the pot.
            For CallAction on button 0, both players post blinds.
            For CheckAction, advances to next street if both players have acted.
            For RaiseAction, updates pips and stacks based on raise amount.
